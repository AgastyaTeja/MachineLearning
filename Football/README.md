# Predicting the Winning Football Team using Machine Learning

This project is an attempt to predict the winner of a Football match in English Premier League using supervised Machine Learning Algorithms. The idea is to feed the algorithm last 10 seasons of historical data and betting data to find patterns in them. 

Why this project has been done?
When Leicester City won the English Premier League in 2015/2016 season with 5000 to 1 odds everyone thought it was a fluke but soccer is a complex game and common statistics rarely tell the full story. This project is study project to understand if the game had some patterns by doing exploratory data analysis, parameter tuning and testing the performance of various algorithms.

## Install

This project requires [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/) and the following Python libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [xlrd](https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Football/` and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook EPL_WinPrediction.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook EPL_WinPrediction.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
